I'm currently a summer researcher and astrophysics student at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/students/current.undergraduates/part.ii.astrophysics) with a wide variety of interest.

This summer I have been investigating the potential growth of Kelp in the North Atlantic for the purpose of carbon sequestration. Code coming soon.
