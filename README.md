I'm an astrophysics student at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/students/current.undergraduates/part.ii.astrophysics) with a wide variety of interest.

The main projects I am working on at the moment are a fully featured rocket trajectory simulation and computing assignments for my course. The trajectory simulation includes:
- 6 degrees of freedom (3 translational, 3 rotational)
- Monte Carlo stochastic analysis
- Aerodynamic heating model
- Use of live wind data
- Variable mass and moments of inertia models

The first release can be found [here](https://github.com/CUSF-Simulation/CamPyRoS). At the moment I am working on adding stochastic variability to the wind data by generating a guassian difference profile from historic records and forcasts.

On top of my course I am currently leanring about statistical modeling of dynamic systems and dipping my toes in with atmospheric physics to the end of understanding climate change better.

My goals for 2021 are:
- Finish the rocket simulation and write a paper about it
- Do well on my course
- Improve my understanding and actions to help global warming
- Increasing my experiance of research and industrial applications of my skills

You can email me at [jagoosw@protonmail.com](mail:jagoosw@protonmail.com) and find me on [Twitter @jagosw](https://twitter.com/jagosw) which I seem to mainly use for contesting peoples false claims about COVID and climate change.
