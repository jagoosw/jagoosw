I'm an astrophysics student at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/students/current.undergraduates/part.ii.astrophysics) with a wide variety of interest.

The main projects I am working on at the moment are a fully featured rocket trajectory simulation and computing assignments for my course. The rocket simulation is unique in including a Monte Carlo stochastic simulation including guassian process wind noise and will be available soon when preliminary documentation is complete. Heres a few plots from a previous version:

</p>
On top of my course I am currently leanring about statistical modeling of dynamic systems and dipping my toes in with atmospheric physics to the end of understanding climate change better.

My goals for 2021 are:
- Finish the rocket simulation and write a paper about it
- Do well on my course
- Improve my understanding and actions to help global warming
- Increasing my experiance of research and industrial applications of my skills

You can email me at [jagoosw@protonmail.com](mail:jagoosw@protonmail.com) and find me on [Twitter @jagosw](https://twitter.com/jagosw) which I seem to mainly use for contesting peoples false claims about COVID and climate change.

I can also be found:
- My website [jagosw.com](https://jagosw.com) which doesn't get updated very much

Some stats (please note this doesn't include my current trajectory simulation project which has >8000 lines of code and >300 commits):
