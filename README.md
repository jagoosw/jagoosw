I'm an astrophysics student at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/students/current.undergraduates/part.ii.astrophysics) with a wide variety of interest.

The main projects I am working on at the moment are a fully featured rocket trajectory simulation and computing assignments for my course. The trajectory simulation includes:
- 6 degrees of freedom (3 translational, 3 rotational)
- Monte Carlo stochastic analysis
- Aerodynamic heating model
- Use of live wind data
- Variable mass and moments of inertia models

The first release can be found [here](https://github.com/CUSF-Simulation/CamPyRoS). At the moment I am working on adding stochastic variability to the wind data by generating a guassian difference profile from historic records and forcasts. I also recently published [narpy](https://pypi.org/project/narpy/) a NASA AMES file Reader in Python which I developed as a required dependency for the wind analysis and am currently working on a library, [getgfs](https://github.com/jagoosw/getgfs), to extract GFS weather forcasts without using the iris library as it has proved to fail often when trying to use it on multiple platforms.

On top of my course I am currently leanring about statistical modeling of dynamic systems and dipping my toes in with atmospheric physics to the end of understanding climate change better.
